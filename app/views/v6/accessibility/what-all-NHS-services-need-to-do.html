      <h2 id="accessibility-and-the-law">Accessibility and the law</h2>
      <p>If your service isn’t accessible to everyone who needs it, you may be breaking the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">2010 Equality Act</a>.</p>
      <p>New accessibility regulations say that public sector websites must meet accessibility standards and publish an accessibility statement. You can find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">more about the new regulations on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
     
      
      <h2>Meeting the requirements</h2>  
      <p>NHS digital services must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>meet at least level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1</a>) - and aim for AAA where possible</li>
        <li>work on the most commonly used assistive technologies - including screen magnifiers </li>
        <li>include people with access needs in user research</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Internal services</h3>
      <p>NHS staff and civil servants are users too and the NHS is committed to equality, diversity and inclusion. Internal services need to meet the same accessibility requirements.</p>

      <h3>Suppliers and contractors</h3>
      <p>External suppliers contracted to the NHS must also make sure their work meets the same standard.</p>
      <p>The NHS may test the product or ask suppliers to arrange an independent accessibility test.</p>


      <h2>Why it's important</h2>
      <p>In the UK, almost 1 in 5 people have a disability of some kind. Many more have temporary or situational disabilities, like an illness or injury.</p>
      <p>When you’re working on NHS services, think about how people with different needs might use what you’re making.</p>
      <p>For example, can someone with dyslexia read your content easily? Or how would someone with a broken arm interact on a mobile device?</p>
