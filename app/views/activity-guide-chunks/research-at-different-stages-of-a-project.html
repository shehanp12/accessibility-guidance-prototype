        <p>How you involve people with different abilities at each stage varies. This is a general outline.</p>

        <ul>
                    <li>Include people with access needs in interviews from the start.</li>
                    <li>Use accessible survey software. </li>
                    <li>If you're testing paper or low-fidelity mock-ups, you can include people with hearing, communication, and dyslexia access needs. You may be able to include people with other needs too if you adapt the scenario, for example by using the wizard-behind-a-curtain method to explore screenreader interactions. (This is where users think that they are using a real system but in fact the researcher is controlling it.)</li>
                    <li>You can also test prototype code with people with mobility, cognitive and vision (magnification) issues.</li>
                    <li>You should be able to test production code with everyone. Include people who use speech output, speech input, and colour-changing plugins.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>A Home Office blog on <a href="https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/12/21/working-together-to-achieve-accessibility/">Working together to achieve accessibility</a> explains how they test accessibility at different stages in the development lifecycle.</p>
