    <p>The <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns">components</a> in the service manual are well tested and ready to use. Before you design a new component, please test an existing component and show that there's a clear need for something new.</p>
    <p>Discuss any new components with other members of your team. You need to make sure that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have good evidence that the new component is the best way of meeting the user need</li>
      <li>it will be accessible</li>
      <li>you <a href="/v6/accessibility/testing">test it</a></li>
      <li>you share what you've learnt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bear in mind that new components add an overhead of testing, from a technical and a usability point of view, and maintenance.</p>
