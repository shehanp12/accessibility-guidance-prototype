        <p>People who can't see may not understand instructions that refer to colour or the location of page elements.</p>

        <p>For example, do not say "Press the red button on the right".</p>
        <p>If someone is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>zoomed in, the button may not be on the right</li>
            <li>"colour blind", they may not be able to tell the difference between red and green</li>
            <li>using a screenreader, they may not see the colour - and location, for them, is simply up or down</li>
