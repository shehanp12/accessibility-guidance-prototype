    <h4 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">Colour and location</h4>

    <p>For people who cannot see a page or have converted it into a different format, the colour and location of page elements will change. Therefore providing instructions that rely on those aspects will be problematic.</p>

    <p>For example, do not say "Press the red button on the right".</p>

    <ul>
        <li>For someone who is zoomed in, the button may not be on the right</li>
        <li>For someone with colour blindness, the button may not be differentiated from a green button</li>
        <li>For someone using a screenreader, the colour is not available and the location is simple up or down</li>
    </ul>
