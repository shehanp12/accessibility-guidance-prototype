        <p>Some images are functional, meaning that they initiate an action. An example is an <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/action-link">action link</a>. If people can't see the image, they need an alternative which may be in the form of "alt&#8209;text".</p>

        <p>W3C has information about <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/">how to deal with different kinds of functional image</a>.</p>
