        <p>Some images are "functional". That means that they trigger an action. If people can't see the image, they need an alternative. You can use "alt&#8209;text" or sometimes  "visually-hidden".</p>

        <p>W3C has information about <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/">how to deal with different kinds of functional image</a>.</p>
        <p>For some common NHS examples of functional images, see the close and search icons and the logo in the <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/header">header component</a> in the service manual. Another example is the <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/action-link">action link</a>.
