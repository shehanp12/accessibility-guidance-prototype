          <p>Make sure that every form field has a label that tells users what information they need to enter.</p>

            <details class="nhsuk-details">
            <summary class="nhsuk-details__summary">
                <span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text">
               More about labels
                </span>
            </summary>
            <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
              
          <p>Generally the label should be visible.</p>    
         
        <p>Put the label next to the form field so that the user is clear which field it relates to.</p>
        <p>Give grouped items a "legend". You can see examples in the <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/checkboxes">checkboxes</a> and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/radios">radios </a> components in the service manual.</p>
        <p>To test the code is correct, you can usually click on the label and the field should be focused by the browser. Otherwise, check there is a "for" attribute on the label and that it matches the "id" attribute of the field.</p>
