    <h2>Recruit people with disabilities</h2>

    <p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/v6/accessibility/user-research">User research</a>

    <div class="chunk-content">

        <p>Ask your recruitment company to include disabled people. If they say it's too hard or that there'll be an extra cost for this, get quotes from other recruiters. You should be able to find one which will recruit people with different needs at no extra cost.</p>
        <p>Build relationships with charities and other organisations who represent or work with people who have access needs. They may be able to put you in touch with people. Do not forget to tell them afterwards how their feedback and time has changed your product or service. Or offer them something in return, like training or advice.</p>

            <div class="nhsuk-details__text">

        <p>The mix of participants will vary depending on the type of research or interface you're testing. Try to include people with:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>learning and cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, ADHD, or a learning or intellectual disability</li>
            <li>limited mobility, for example, someone who uses voice or another alternative input</li>
            <li>low vision, for example, someone who adjusts their computer with a screen magnifier or zoom controls</li>
            <li>no vision, for example, someone who uses a screen reader</li>
            <li>no hearing - you may need to a sign language interpreter at the same time</li>               
        </ul>
        <p>You don't need to include all of these different abilities in 1 day, but you should do during the project.</p>
