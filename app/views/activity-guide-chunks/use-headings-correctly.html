        <p>Some people with access needs rely on headings to navigate the page. Make sure your headings reflect the page structure.</p>

        <details class="nhsuk-details">
            <summary class="nhsuk-details__summary">
                <span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text">
               Structure headings for accessibility
                </span>
            </summary>
            <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
                
              
                <p>The H1 is the same as the page title. You should have only 1 H1 on a page.</p>

                <p>Each main section of your page should start with an H2 and each sub-section of an H2 with an H3. It is possible to have sub-sub-sections which start with an H4.</p>

                <p>With each heading, ask yourself if it's a sub-section of the previous heading. If not, it should be at the same level as (or higher than) the previous section.</p>

                <p>Make sure that headings follow the correct "nesting" order and don't skip levels. The structure of the page is the key thing, not the size and style of the text.</p>

                <p>You can use a web developer toolbar (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer-toolbar/deeboegbjcnfgidliakhpoapnpomphji?hl=en">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/web-developer/">Firefox</a>) to view the overall heading structure of the page.</p>
