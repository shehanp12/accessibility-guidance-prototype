        <p>It's easier for people to read and interact with content if you use colours that contrast well. Where possible, the NHS aims to meet the higher level (AAA) requirements for contrast.</p>
        <p>This means that the contrast between the text colour and background colour should be a minimum of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>7:1 – for small text (smaller than 24px or 19px if bold)</li>
                <li>4.5:1 – for large text (larger than 24px or 19px if bold)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>For components (like text inputs) or graphics (like icons), the contrast between the graphical element and the adjacent colour should be a minimum ratio of 4.5:1.</p>

            <p>Use a tool to check the colour contrast:</p>

        <p>Use a tool to calculate the ratio between the graphical element and the adjacent colour - for example, the white arrow (foreground) and the green background in an <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/action-link">action link</a>/p>
            
        <p>If a graphic, such as an icon, is essential to understand the content, it must meet the minimum contrast ratio. If it also has text, it doesn't have to meet the requirement but this is still recommended.</p>

        <p>Components that are visible but not currently active (like a submit button that isn't active until you've filled in the form) are exempt from the requirement, but if you can meet the minimum contrast without it being confusing, that will help people with low vision.</p>
