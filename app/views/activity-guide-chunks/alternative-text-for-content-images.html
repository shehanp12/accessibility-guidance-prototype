    <div class="chunk-content">
        <p>People who can't see an image need an alternative to understand the content. You need to add "alt-text" to explain what's in the image.</p>
        <p>You can use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm">Chrome's Web Developer toolbar</a> to visually show the alt-text next to each image.</p>

        <details class="nhsuk-details">
        <summary class="nhsuk-details__summary">
            <span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text">
            Informative images
            </span>
        </summary>
        <div class="nhsuk-details__text">

            <p>The content of the alt-text depends on the image and its context. If the image is part of the main content of the page (not a <a href="/v6/accessibility/testing#alternative-text-for-functional-images">functional image</a> - one that initiates an action), use the alt-text to describe the image in a way that makes sense in the context.</p>
            
            <p>You don't need to explain that it's an image because screenreaders usually announce that. Keep alt-text to a sentence or 2 and no longer than 250 characters.</p>
            
            <p>Imagine you were reading the page out to a friend. How would you describe the image?</p>

            <p>This is an image from the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bullous-pemphigoid/">NHS.UK bullous pemphigoid page</a>. It comes under a heading "Check if you have bullous pemphigoid". The alt-text is: "Lots of sore red patches with small blisters spread across white skin on a woman's chest." It explains what users can see in the picture.</p>

            <div class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">
            {{ image({
                "src": "https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/images/S_0318_Bullous_pemphigoid_lesions_.2e16d0ba.fill-320x213.jpg",
                "alt": "Lots of sore red patches with small blisters spread across white skin on a woman's chest.",
                "caption": "It can affect large areas of the body or limbs."
            }) }}
            </div>

            <p>The caption underneath the image assumes that the user can either see the image or read the alt-text. It shouldn't duplicate the alt-text. Instead, use it to explain why the image is there and what you want users to conclude from it - for example, how serious their symptom is or what stage their condition has reached.</p>

            <p>Here's another example. The alt-text is "Small red spots on white skin". The caption explains that that's how chickenpox starts.</p>
            <div class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">
            {{ image({
              "src": "https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/images/ABF9YH_GDGeL2X.2e16d0ba.fill-320x213.jpg",
              "alt": "Small red spots on white skin",
              "caption": "1. Chickenpox starts with red spots. They can appear anywhere on the body."
            }) }}
            </div>

            <p>If you have a complex image that you can't describe in short alt-text (such as an infographic), include a longer description in some other way. You can use <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/expander">an expander</a>, for example, underneath the infographic with a text explanation.</p>

            <p>If your image has text which conveys its meaning, follow <a href="/v6/accessibility/frontend#alternative-text-for-functional-images">the guidance on functional images</a>. An example would be a link to a health app which includes a brand image and the name of the app. The app name says the same as the brand image, so the image doesn't need explaining.</p>

        <p>Decorative images are there to attract users' attention or motivate them, but they don't help users understand the topic. An example might be a bowl of fruit on a healthy eating page.</p>
        <p>If your image is decorative, give it a null text alternative like this: (<code>alt=""</code>).</p>
