    <div class="chunk-content">
        <p>Ask yourself how your project will affect people with access needs, how much work you will need to do to make it accessible and whether your team has the capacity and expertise to do it.</p>

            Questions to ask yourself
            </span>
        </summary>
        <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
            <p>If the answer to any of these questions is 'yes', it's a sign that the project will need a higher level of accessibility expertise or support.</p>

            <h5>Does the project affect people with access needs differently?</h5>
            <p>For example, does the user's journey include physical access to a GP surgery? If so, <a href="/v6/accessibility/user-research#include-people-with-disabilities">include disabled people</a> in any user research.</p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Will the project use any technologies you haven't already tested for accessibility?</h5>
            <p>You will need to test them, and the team working on them will need a higher level of accessibility knowledge or support.</p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Is the project about a complex subject with lots of jargon?</h5>
            <p>You'll need to allow time to <a href="/v6/accessibility/content-design#understandable-content">write content that's easy to understand</a>.</p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Will the interface need new components?</h5>
            <p>You should show that you've tested existing components and demonstrated a clear need for new ones. You must also make sure new components are accessible and test them.</p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Will there be a different colour scheme? </h5>
            <p>You'll need to test the colour combinations, both for text and graphical <a href="/v6/accessibility/design#check-colour-contrast">contrast</a>.</p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Will the project use multimedia, PDFs, infographics, large data tables or other less common content? </h5>
            <p>Check the capabilities of the systems and the people creating them so that you can be sure that they will be accessible. </p>

            <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Is there a reason to include 'Easy Read' documents or translations?</h5>
            <p>If there is some key information that everyone must understand (such as a guide to a new national service), then consider including an Easy Read version for people with low-literacy or learning disabilities. Or you could link to Easy Read content from other organisations.</p>
