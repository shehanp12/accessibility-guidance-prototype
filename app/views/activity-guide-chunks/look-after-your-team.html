        <p>It's important that the team supports one another. Sometimes doing research with people who have access needs is tiring and emotional. Users might tell you stories that are hard to hear or you might see them struggle.<p>
        <p>Itâ€™s okay to take some time out during a day of research or, as a user researcher, to ask for someone to stand in for you.</p>
        <p>Check in with your team mates during and after research and take time to reflect together.</p>
