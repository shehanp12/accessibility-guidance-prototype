    <h2>Identify target groups and accessibility challenges</h2>

    <p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/v6/accessibility/user-research">User research</a>

    <p>In the discovery part of the project, you need to understand how it will affect people with access needs. Consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>whether it will cause particular accessibility challenges</li>
         <li>whether it will affect disabled people differently</li>
         <li>how it might affect people with complex needs</li>
           </ul>
    
    <p>For example, how will your project contact people? Some people can't make phone calls and some people can't read paper.</p>

    <p>GOV.UK has a set of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles">user profiles to help you understand disabilities and impairments</a>.</p>

    <p>Your organisation may have an internal network of people who have access needs. (NHS Digital has an Ability Network, for example.) Colleagues with access needs may be willing to help with initial research and establishing the requirements for a project. But you must also test your product with your target audience.</p>
