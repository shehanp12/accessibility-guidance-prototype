        <p>Consider using video as well as text. Some people find it easier to understand.</p>
        <p>With all video and multimedia, you should make sure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the interface is accessible for keyboard and screen reader users (including play/pause buttons and the location slider)</li>
            <li>if the user cannot see or hear it, they can still understand it</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are using a video on its own (in other words, if you don't repeat the video content elsewhere on the page), it must have a transcript. The transcript should include all the dialogue, relevant sound effects, and visual content.</p>

        <p>If the video includes dialogue, it should also have captions.</p>

        <p>If the video relies on visual content to convey information (for example, diagrams without a verbal description), it's best to include an audio description. This isn't essential but you must have a transcript.</p>
