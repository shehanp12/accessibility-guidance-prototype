    <h4 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">Define focus styles</h4>

    <p>Everyone should be able to access all interactive components with a keyboard (or equivalent device) and it should be clear which element or link has “focus”.</p>

    <p>Define the focus styles to guide people, they need to clearly identify the current focus position on the page. The browser default indicator is generally not good enough.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>

    <div class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">
        {{ image({
        "src": "https://via.placeholder.com/300x150",
        "alt": "Placeholder image",
        "caption": "Caption"
        }) }}
    </div>
