        <p>Everyone should be able to access all interactive components with a keyboard (or equivalent device) and it should be clear which element or link has “focus”.</p>

        <p>Define the focus styles to guide people, they need to clearly identify the current focus position on the page. The browser default indicator is generally not good enough.</p>

        <p>Examples:</p>

        <div class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">
            {{ image({
