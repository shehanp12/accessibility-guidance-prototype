    <h4 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">Setting the language of the content</h4>

    <p>In order for screenreaders (and search engines) to know what language the page is a small bit of markup is needed in each page.</p>

    <p>In the HTML element the language can be set to English for the whole page: <strong>html lang="en"</strong></p>

    <p>Where there are changes of language within the page, these should be marked up as well:<p>
  
    <p>You can search for health professionals for the area you are staying in via <a href=”…” lang=”fr”>l’Assurance Maladie</a> website (information in French only).</p>
    
    <p>The lang attribute can be applied to any container.</p>
