    <p>Make automated testing part of your build process or use it for a scan across your website or parts of it. Remember that automated tests only check some of what you need to test.</p>

    <p>Manual checks are the most efficient way to test for accessibility issues on individual pages or components. This guidance focuses on these checks.</p> 

    <p>Use this checklist [LINK TO CHECKLIST] and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-insights-fo/pbjjkligggfmakdaogkfomddhfmpjeni">Microsoft's Accessibility Insights Chrome extension</a>.</p>
    <p>It is important to <a href="/v4/accessibility/getting-started">learn about accessibility</a> before you start. Otherwise you can waste a lot of time wondering about things which aren't a problem or disagreeing with your colleagues.</p>
