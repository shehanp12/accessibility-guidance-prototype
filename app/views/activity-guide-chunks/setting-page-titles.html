        <p>A good page title helps users find what they what and recognise they're in the right place. It's the link that shows in search results and the first thing a screenreader will read out when the user lands on a page. </p>
        <p>Each page title must be unique and descriptive. Keep it concise and consider putting important keywords near the beginning.</p>

        <p>Best practice is generally: Page name | Section – Sitename</p>

        <p>For example: Achalasia | Health A to Z – NHS</p>

        <p>The first element (here "Achalasia") is the main heading of the page.</p>

        <p>If you can, use templates to keep things consistent and use your content management system to generate everything after the pipe symbol.</p>
