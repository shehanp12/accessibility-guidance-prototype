    <h4 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">Key questions for new projects</h3>

    <p>If the answer to any the questions below is ‘yes’, then it is a sign the project will need a higher level of accessibility expertise or support.</p>

        <h5>Does the project impact people with disabilities differently?</h5>
        <p>For example: Does the user's journey include physical access to a GP surgery? In which case include people with disabilities in any user research.</p>

        <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Will the project be using new technologies? (Rather than the standard CMS and components) </h5>
        <p>If so, the capabilities of the technology need to be assessed, and the team working on it will need a higher level of accessibility knowledge or support.</p>

        <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Will the interface require new components? </h5>
        <p>These would need work to make accessible and be tested to ensure they are accessible.</p>

        <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Will there be a different colour scheme? </h5>
        <p>These colour combinations would need testing, both for text and graphical contrast.</p>

        <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Will the project use multimedia PDFs, infographics, large data tables or other less common content? </h5>
        <p>If so, check the capabilities of the system and the people creating them. NHS UK has experience making these types of content accessible, but it does not happen by default.</p>

        <h5 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Is there a reason to include 'easy read' documents?</h5>
        <p>If there is some key information that everyone must understand (such as the guide to start using GP online services), then consider including an easy read version for people with low-literacy or learning disabilities.</p>
