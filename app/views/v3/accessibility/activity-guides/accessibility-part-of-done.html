    <p>Accessibility is part of being 'done', and it is the manager's responsibility to ensure that has been accounted for. In most cases it is a matter of ensuring that the team are checking the work as they go along.</p>

        How to include accessibility as part of done
        </span>
    </summary>
    <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
        <p>For a simple statement about "done", you can use these four main questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can you use it without a mouse?</li>
            <li>Does it provide good contrast and enable zooming?</li>
            <li>Does it provide appropriate information to screen readers?</li>
            <li>It is easy to understand?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If in doubt: ask questions early.</p>
        <p>The sooner the accessibility requirements are considered, the easier it is.</p>
        <p>The amount of testing & validation towards the end of a project will vary depending on the scale of the project and type of changes that are being made. If it is a new service, or replacement for a service then you should arrange 3rd party testing. If it is a small update, the teams internal testing may be sufficient. </p>
