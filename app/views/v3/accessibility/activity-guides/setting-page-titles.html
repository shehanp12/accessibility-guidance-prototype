    <h4 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">Setting page titles</h4>

    <p>Each page title should be unique, descriptive and concise. It is the first thing read out to a screenreader when landing on a page, and the link shown in search results. In both cases a good page title helps when finding the page or switching between tabs.</p>

    <p>For content managed pages the title is based on the title field in the CMS, and fits into a templated pattern.</p>

    <p>Best practice is generally: Page name | Section â€“ Sitename</p>
