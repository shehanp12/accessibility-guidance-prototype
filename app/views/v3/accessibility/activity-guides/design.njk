<h3>Graphic and interaction design</h3>

<h4>Define colour contrast</h4>
<p>Using colours that contrast well makes it much easier for people to read content comfortably. Ensure the colour contrast between the text colour and background colour meets the following minimum ratio:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Small text (4.5:1) – text smaller than 24px or 19px if bold.</li>
    <li>Large text (3:1) – text larger than 24px or 19px if bold.</li>
</ul>
